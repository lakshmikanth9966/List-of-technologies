    <p><strong>C</strong> is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs to develop the UNIX operating system.</p>
    <p>C is a compiled language, which means that the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed. It is known for its efficiency and control over system resources, making it suitable for system programming, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.</p>
