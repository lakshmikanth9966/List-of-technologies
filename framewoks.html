    <h1>Frameworks</h1>
   <p>
        Frameworks are pre-built software platforms that provide a foundation for developing applications. They offer reusable code, libraries, and tools to streamline the development process, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than starting from scratch. Frameworks can be used in various programming languages and are essential for creating robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Frameworks can be categorized into different types based on their purpose, such as web frameworks, mobile frameworks, and desktop application frameworks. They often follow specific design patterns and architectural styles, which help in organizing code and promoting best practices in software development.
   </p>
    <p>
        Some popular frameworks include Django for Python, Spring Boot for Java, and React for JavaScript. Each framework has its own strengths and is suited for different types of projects, making it important for developers to choose the right framework based on their specific needs and project requirements.
