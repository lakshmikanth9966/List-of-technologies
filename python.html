    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.</p>
    <p>Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), and large systems development. It is known for its portability across platforms, robustness, and security features.</p>
